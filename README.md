# ValhallaQueue
The Valhalla Queue is a Java project that simulates a typical queue system at a post office using multithreading and JavaFX. In this simulation, each customer in the queue is represented by a separate thread, allowing for realistic and concurrent interactions. The application uses JavaFX to visually represent the queue, where customers arrive, wait, and are served in real-time.

Key features include:

Thread-based Simulation: Each customer operates on its own thread, simulating real-world concurrency.
Queue Management: Customers join the queue and are processed in the order they arrive, mimicking typical post office operations.
Visual Representation: The queue and customer activities are displayed using JavaFX, providing a user-friendly interface with real-time updates.
Post Office Environment: The project simulates a working post office, complete with waiting times, counter interactions, and a dynamic customer flow.
This project demonstrates how to manage multiple tasks concurrently using threads and provides an interactive way to visualize queue processing with a graphical interface.
